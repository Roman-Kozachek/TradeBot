# TradeBot
Development of a ForEx TradeBot.

The goal of this project is to develop a trading bot for ForEx trading using modern Machine Learning techniques, such as Recurrent Neural Networks and Deep Q-learning Neural Networks.
My research is split into five parts:
Part 1 - Data exploration and preparation
Part 2 - Building an Environment
Part 3 - Building an Agent
Part 4 - Designing a visual Testsight
Part 5 - Training and Testing

IPython notebooks contain in-depth explanations to every step of this journey, but are not necessarily RunAll'able, because they're quite old and I didn't bother updating them. Good news is that you can find working code in classes folder.

So feel free to explore. Unfortunately, you won't find data to reproduce this research for yourself, as I didn't bother uploading it yet :)
